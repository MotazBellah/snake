# Snake Game

#### From Wikipedia:

Snake is a video game that came out in the late 1970s and has maintained popularity since then, becoming somewhat of a classic. The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the "walls" that surround the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows. The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress.

# Rules of Snake Game

- The snake moves only north, south, east, or west.
- "Apples" appear at random locations.
- There is always exactly one apple visible at any given time.
- When the snake "eats" (runs into) an apple, it gets longer.
- The game continues until the snake "dies".
- A snake dies by either (1) running into the edge of the board, or (2) by running into its own tail.
- The final score is based on the number of apples eaten by the snake.
